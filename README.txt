Please run Toppie.py in this current directory. 

This program plots a density distribution, compliance and maxmium error 
with respect to the number of iterations when executed. Further details 
are provided at the start of the program, which specify how to navigate
the file. The program is initially set up for a 60 x 20 Half MBB problem
for the convenience of the reader.

There are two other folders in this directory:

1. Misc Toppie Functions
	This folder contains other modifications of Toppie which 
	output different results from compliance vs fibre angle plots,
	a visualisation of the lagrange multiplier and sensitivity 
	plots.

	------------> the author recommends a reader to execute these 
		      files, as they offer great insights into the 
		      aspects discussed above. They may aid the reader's
	  	      understanding. Furthermore, they complement sections
		      in the final report.

2. Testing 
	This folder contains two files which were used to validate 
	the author's understanding on some aspects of the code.
